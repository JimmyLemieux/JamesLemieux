                            <p>Caseware International Inc. is a leading software company of delivering internal audit products to various accountant firms across the globe. The head office in Toronto was responsible for all the various products that the company offered. Which includes engagement automation, data analysis and internal audit workflows.</p>

                            <i><h5>Job Description</h5></i>
                            <p>When I first arrived to Caseware the first thing that happened to me was that I was informed that my team was actually no longer a team. You could imagine, my first thoughts were that I was going to be asked to pack my bag and go home. Yet to my surprise they had a team on Caseware Cloud that would be a perfect fit for me. Caseware cloud being a web application, I was using front end frameworks such as Angular and Typescript to develop dynamic component libraries that would be used all around the app. I was also responsible for writing component unit tests and took part in design meetings to plan layout and structure of new features that we were working on. In Caseware Cloud there are separate squads that are responsible for various areas on the web application. I was placed on the Tactical Squad whose main focus was on miscellaneous bugs and features all over the application. However, when I joined the squad, they were in progress working on a newer version of the already established query feature called eQuery. Which allows for firms and clients to communicate various forms, files and agreements all within our application. Eliminating the risk of data being lost in emails or in third party software. My team first introduced me to the environment by getting me started with some issues that were very easy and intuitive. I quickly grew more comfortable and took on harder bugs and full features to myself. Nearing the end of my internship I was implementing a library that would be used to track analytics and user stories within Caseware cloud. I then began to collaborate with server squad and dev ops to complete stories that could affect other squads. The increased responsibility that they gave me was very rewarding.</p>

                            <i><h5>Work Term Goals (May - August)</h5></i>
                            <p>My first and I think my most important goal for this term was not to be afraid to ask for help when I need it. If you know me personally then you know that sometimes I can be stubborn when I am working to figure something out. I guess it is a curse and a blessing to do everything in my power to figuring out a problem before asking for help. But I quickly realized that this is not always the best way to work. Especially when working with such a large code base with little to know knowledge on how the product works. When asking my more experienced team mates for help I was able to access knowledge much easier and quicker. Resulting in me learning more effectively and being able to push out software on time and within our weekly sprints. Lesson learned, I can’t do everything by myself (unfortunately).</p>
                            <hr class="my-6"/>
                            <p>My second goal was actually to be more involved with company culture and socials. During my first months at Caseware I never really participated in the monthly company socials. These socials allowed for all employees to get together and have a good time after working hours. Food, drinks and board games were provided for free at the expense of the company. However, due to my living circumstances (living in Kitchener/Waterloo). I decided to take an earlier train back home to prevent me from getting home at 9pm and then waking up at 6 am the next day to repeat a dreadful, draining process. In my last months I made the sacrifice to come to the socials and it was definitely worth it! I feel as if I made connections with my co-workers that will last a lifetime.</p>
                            <hr class="my-6"/>
                            <p>My final goal for this term was to take increase the amount I was taking part in team discussions. I guess you could say my true goal is to learn more about the actual product that we were working on since most meetings require that knowledge to offer an opinion. But I felt as if I could have offered more opinions and insights when refining new bugs and features. The way I could have done this is simply just by asking questions in these meetings. Simply if something doesn’t make sense or if I am unsure about the direction of the conversation to intervene and ask a question about the topic. Doing this could have shown more intuition and initiative.</p>

                            <i><h5>Work Term Goals (September - December)</h5></i>
                            <p>My first learning goal for this work term was to get more involved with my oral communication skills and having more face to face conversation with my coworkers at the company. Communication is made fairly easy at Caseware. We use an IM called Slack which you can come into contact with anyone in the company within the click of a few buttons. This is effective for short quick questions but when it comes to more complicated questions which will probably have a more complicated response this doesn’t work the best in my opinion. It would be a lot more effective to have a meeting or to find someone at their desk to discuss the issue at hand. Luckily, Caseware makes it fairly easy to book meetings in any of the meeting rooms throughout the day (when the rooms are available). I slowly began to book quick meetings whenever there was a major task at hand. Which proved to be useful and time effective.</p>

                            <p>My second learning goal is to thoroughly check over my commit branch before pushing code to a pull request. When working with a lot of different files for a feature or a bug, it is easy to commit code that you use for your personal debugging or code that does not follow company standard. This results in longer pull requests and reducing the amount of software that our team can get out for the sprint. It is hard for developers to put down the things that they are currently working on to review someone else's code to find out you left a print statement in the code. The fix for this is to use graphical version control programs such as Git Gui or SourceTree to preview content of all files before committing. Using these softwares can eliminate commits with some garbage code.</p>
                            <hr class="my-6"/>
                            <p>My final learning goal for this work term is to continue to broaden my understanding of Angular and Typescript. During the end of the work term, Caseware Cloud began a weekly technical demo. Where all teams got together and demoed some new feature to frameworks or language that they were using. This really made me realize how much I really don’t know as a whole. These demos inspired me to always look into these things and to keep up to date with the latest updates and technologies that are available to us. The field of Software is always changing and it is very easy to become obsolete. That is one thing I like about Computer Science, it is a never ending journey of the pursuit of knowledge.</p>

                            <p>My experience at Caseware was extremely positive. The skills that I have acquired and the connections I have made will surely last a lifetime. I want to thank the University of Guelph Coop program and Caseware for making this possible. I am truly excited to see where my next coop experience will bring me. </p>

                            <i><h5>Acknowledgments</h5></i>
                            <p>I wanted to give a hats off to some of the people I have met during my 8 months at Caseware. First of all, I would like to acknowledge Reece Goddard. Reece was the one who first gave me the interview and hired me for the position. Thanks to Reece’s efforts, when my position was changed I was placed on a team in which my skills could shine and where there was room to learn and grow as a developer. I would also like to acknowledge my product owner Shun Chen. Shun was super helpful in showing me the ins and outs of our product. As well as easing me into the team and making me feel like an important part of the team right off the bat. Which definitely improved my working performance. Some of the developers that I would like to thank are Kyle Good and Jonnathan Zauritz for helping through the code base and giving me tips on how to solve the bugs and conflicts that I faced. The most important part about that was they never fully gave me the answer. Instead they guided me in the right direction to ensure that I would learn something in the process. My team was super helpful in assisting me to become successful during these 8 months. Definitely a place where I could see myself working full time.</p>
